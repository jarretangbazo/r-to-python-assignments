# HW02: Exploring and visualizing data
The goal of this assignment is to practice transforming and exploring data.

## Exploring Clean Data
The United States experiences far more mass shooting events than any other developed country in the world. While policymakers, politicians, the media, activists, and the general public recognize the widespread prevalence of these tragic events, policies intended to stop these events should be grounded in evidence and empirical data. Regrettably, mass shootings are not well-documented in the United States, and generalizable data is difficult to collect.

In July 2012, in the aftermath of a mass shooting in a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, [Mother Jones](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/07/mass-shootings-map/) published a report on mass shootings in the United States since 1982. Importantly, they provided the underlying data set as an [open-source database](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/) for anyone interested in studying and understanding this criminal behavior.

### Explore the data
**Very specific prompts**
1. Generate a data frame that summarizes the number of mass shootings per year. Print the data frame as a formatted table.
2. Generate a bar chart that identifies the number of mass shooters associated with each race category. The bars should be sorted from highest to lowest.
3. Generate a boxplot visualizing the number of total victims, by type of location. Redraw the same plot, but remove the Las Vegas Strip massacre from the dataset.

**More open-ended questions**
Answer the following questions. Generate appropriate figures/tables to support your conclusions. Make sure to provide 1-2 brief paragraphs of written interpretation of your tables/figures. Graphs and tables alone will not be sufficient to answer this question.

1. How many white males with prior signs of mental illness initiated a mass shooting after 2000?
2. Which month of the year has the most mass shootings? Generate a bar chart sorted in chronological order to provide evidence of your answer.
3. How does the distribution of mass shooting fatalities differ between White and Black shooters? What about White and Latino shooters?

**Very open-ended**
1. Are mass shootings with shooters suffering from mental illness different from mass shootings with no signs of mental illness in the shooter? Assess the relationship between mental illness and total victims, mental illness and location type, and the intersection of all three variables.

**Formatting graphs**
While you are practicing exploratory data analysis, your final graphs should be appropriate for sharing with outsiders. That means your graphs should have:
- A title
- Labels on the axes

This is just a starting point. Consider adopting your own color scales, taking control of your legends (if any), playing around with themes, etc.

**Formatting tables**
When presenting tabular data, make sure you format it correctly. Add a caption, and label the columns.

Your assignment should be submitted as a Jupyter notebook.
