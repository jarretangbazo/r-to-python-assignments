# HW01: Edit README.md
Original R Version: README.md should contain a brief biography about myself. It should contain at least 4 of the following elements:
- Headers
- Emphasis (italics or bold)
- Lists
- Images (e.g., add a picture of myself to my repo and embed it in my README)
- Links

Python Conversion Notes: Instead of editing a README file, I create an ABOUTME.md file instead and use it as an introduction to who I am.
