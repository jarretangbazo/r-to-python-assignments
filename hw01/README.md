# HW01: Create README.md
Original R Version: The original R version was to edit a README.md file. The goal was to test my software installation, GitHub setup, and to demonstrate competency in markdown. 

The README.md contained a brief biography about myself and required at least 4 of the following elements for full marks:
- Headers
- Emphasis (*italics* or **bold**)
- Lists
- Images (e.g., add a picture of myself to my repo and embed it in my README)
- Links

Python Learning Goals: Instead of editing a README file, I create an ABOUTME.md file instead and use it as an introduction to who I am.
